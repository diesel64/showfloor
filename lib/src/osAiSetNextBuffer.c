/**
 * It is worth noting that a previous hardware bug has been fixed by a software
 * patch in osAiSetNextBuffer. This bug occurred when the address of the end of the
 * buffer specified by osAiSetNextBuffer was at a specific value. This value
 * occurred when the following was true:
 *
 *     (vaddr + nbytes) & 0x00003FFF == 0x00002000
 *
 * (when the buffer ends with address of lower 14 bits 0x2000) In this case, the
 * DMA transfer does not complete successfully. This can cause clicks and pops in
 * the audio output. This bug no longer requires special handling by the application
 * because it is now patched by osAiSetNextBuffer.
